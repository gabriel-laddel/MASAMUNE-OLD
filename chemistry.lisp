;; "brain chemistry and pharmacology" Organic chemiisry, biochemistry; inorganic
;; for foundation - pH, equilibrium, reduction and oxidation. You'll need some
;; physical chemistry, classical thermodynamics, to appreciate what should
;; happen (thermodynamics) and what does happen (kinetics). Diamond (the denser
;; phase) is unstable versus graphite at room pressure, and calculably so,
;; 
;; Diamond is stable to 1000 C in air, 1500 C under hydrogen. CVD diamond is
;; made in vacuum. Know where Official Truth has footnotes. You must be
;; conversant with species, ions, molecules, reactions before you touch organic
;; (which is all that plus wickedly structural).
;; 
;; Use LCAO to understand geometry, structure, hybridization, reactions. LCAO is
;; wholly ad hock and, point of fact, is wrong. It sill works -
;; splendidly. Molecular orbitals are irrelevant until Woodward-Hoffmann.
;; 
;; Hint: The folks who drool advocacy the loudest are clueless about the
;; science, thereby not willfully lying. Government is corrupt, ignorant, and
;; mean. Industry is all that plus desperate.
;; 
;; If you want to play with organic, buy HyperChem Lite. Diddle the molecule
;; together, add hydrogens (drop down menu), assign atom types (same menu), then
;; minimize to at least ten times the recommended iterations plus much smaller
;; acceptable error. Learn how to see into stereograms (HyperChem genertes them,
;; Display/Rendering). 2D representations get sloppy real fast,

;; Do your chair parade. See what the Kahn Academy has to offer. Have more than
;; one texbook. If organic is not the best thing in the world pursued clothed,
;; consider other options. Employment at the bench will be under management that
;; has other goals. Grant funding considers discovery to be unacceptable
;; risk. Remember what they called the first designed degenerate Cope
;; rearrangement - BULLVALENE. It worked. So did its two-step synthesis using no
;; reagents.

;; LCAO for hybridization, geometry, resonance, and 1,3-shifts. Nomenclature and
;; chirality. Woodward-Hoffmann comes later. Carbocations, carbanions,
;; radicals. Carbonyl condensations. Hard and soft acids and bases, Lewis and
;; Bronsted acids and bases. Reductants and oxidants; reagents in general. Name
;; reactions (that you already know as pedagogy). Practice looking into
;; stereograms.

;; NMR, IR, UV-Vis (not so much now), mass spec with database and software. You
;; should have some glassblowing under your belt - Schlenkware; T-, butt, and
;; ring seals; making an ampoule. Own your own didymium glasses and Kennametal
;; cutter. Burn a pencil for its "lead."

;; Synthesis. Work backwards via the synthon approach. We used to read the new
;; Aldrich catalog, and Fieser and Fieser, but both have has gotten out of
;; hand. Spend a weekend/month skimming the main journals - JACS, Angew. Chemie,
;; JOC, Tetrahedron - and what interests you. Never fill a reaction flask more
;; than half full, because the universe hates you. COTTON lab coats, because
;; they don't melt onto your flesh. Don't do anything stupid twice. When in
;; doubt - palladium.

;; Buy HyperChem Lite, oh yes indeed. Remember to add hydrogens, assign atom
;; types, then minimize well below the recommended cutoff for 10 times the
;; recommended iterations, at least. Note how the software is boggled when
;; minimizing high symmetry cage ketones

;; If it isn't fun, you might be a theorist. There is no shame in that - but you
;; don't get to make crystals.
