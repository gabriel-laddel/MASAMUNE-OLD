;;; TODO
;;; - package exports should be a symbol
;;; - notify user when symbols they've attempted to export were not found
;;; - unify with asciilifeform's new internet description
;;; - add MOCL information to the trivial sockets page (does it work?):
;;;   http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/implementation-comparison.shtml
;;;   & "status for currently targeted backends"
;;; http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/
;;; - fix usocket tests, convert to stefil
;;; 
;;; open questions / unimlemented:
;;; 
;;; - security
;;;   - PGP
;;; - allow / disallow reader macros?
;;;
;;; usage
;;; =====
;;; call the function `interactively-network-library' which will walk you
;;; through the process of making your library network ready. keep in mind the
;;; following:
;;;
;;; - exported functions should not return multiple values.
;;;
;;; - symbols you're exporting must name a function or a macro.
;;;
;;; so, what does this have over SLIME'ing around in a restricted envionment?
;;; Well. I don't actually know that it is any better of an idea, honestly. But
;;; I'm not aware of anyone doing either of the previous, and I'm more than open
;;; to, after securing this (or finding out how unfeasible it is to secure)
;;;
;;; as it stands it has the benefit of being written, being more enjoyable to
;;; program for as both a client and a server. So, there is that I guess.
;;;
;;; so what is this then? we have objects tied to WoT keys? how exactly does
;;; that work when you've got 10,000 boxen?
;;;
;;; however it ends up working I think that this model is a pretty good starting
;;; point.
;;;
;;; playing with the setf'ing etc. should be fine so long as you have some
;;; sort of versioning system for PCLOS (ie, a good backup system)
;;;
;;; so lets enumerate a few implementations and see where that gets us:
;;; 
;;; - business
;;; - publicly available webservice
;;; - private service
;;;

;;; http://trilema.com/2013/steganography-or-the-simple-yet-strong-brain-wallet/
;;;
;;; I was thinking about possibly using boxes as a dead drop and from time to
;;; time giving up access to them? this is obviously incorrect. the correct
;;; way to go about these things is to pass messages back and forth. But what
;;; if I want your message to be able to change some state on my box?
;;;
;;; what all of this is based on of course is how much do you trust the other
;;; guy? the correct way to go about this is to have a scale of how much you'll
;;; allow someone else to do based on how much you value the data in question.
;;;
;;; things like facebook are not going to exist in the future, really, and the
;;; only people who will be dealing with "the masses" are cattle ranchers.
;;; we'll leave it up to them to solve I suppose.
;;;
;;; performance
;;; ============================================================================
;;; - what is the maximum number of sockets you can open on a linux box? is this
;;;   tied to threads etc. does it make sense to keep sockets open?
